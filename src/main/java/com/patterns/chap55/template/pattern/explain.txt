A high level blueprint for an algorithm to be completed by inheritors

Algorithm can be decomposed into common parts and specifics.

Strategy pattern does this through composition.

Template Method does the same thing through inheritance

Overall algorithm makes use of Abstract members.

inheritors override the abstract members
parent template method invoked

Template method allows us to define the skeleton of the algorithm with concrete implementations defined in subclass
