Finite State Machines

eg Ordinary Telephone

Changes in state can be explicit or in response to event.

A pattern in which the objects behavior is determined by its state. An object transitions from one state to another(something
needs to trigger a transition)

A formalized construct which manages state and transitions is called a state machine.
