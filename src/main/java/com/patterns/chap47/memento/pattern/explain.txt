Keep a memento of an object's state to return to that state

A system or object goes through set of changes

eg Bank Account

one way to record every change ...Command pattern

another approach is to save the snapshot of system at a particular time which enables user to rollback to 
a particular time.

A token/handle representing  the system state . Let us roll back to a state when token was generated.
May or may not directly expose the state information
